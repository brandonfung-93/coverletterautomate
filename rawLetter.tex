\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,} 

I am delighted to present the attached resume as my application for the POSITION position with COMPANY in response to the position posted on Jobmine.

Currently, I am a candidate for the Honours Bachelor of Computer Science Co-op Program at the University of Waterloo. Throughout my studies, internships and enthusiasm, I gained valuable experiences that I believe would transfer well to this position.

While at American International Group, I had the opportunity to design prototypes that assited internal developers and increased productivity for catastrophe risk management. This exposure taught me how to analyze complicated APIs, extract key functionalities, and refactor code with design patterns. At Bluecoat Systems, I managed a full-stack web environment with little supervision, creating an internal tool that aided product managers in writing reports and presenting the progress for each sprint. In my last work term at BlackBerry, I was solely responsible for writing, automating and managing an entire test suite. 

During my studies, I became familiar with analyzing complicated problems and finding effective solutions. Some valuable strengths I realized during include: a well-rounded Computer Science base, persistence in problem solving, and strong desire for product completion.

Outside of school, I regularly develop and contribute to various personal projects that broadens my software knowledge. As a frequent participant in hackathons, I love creating and developing meaningful applications that solves a problem or increases productivity. My most notable project, Twilio Plays 2048, was even featured online on TechCrunch and the Twilio Official Blog.

The posted position seems like an excellent prospect to use and develop my skills as a POSITION. Thank-you for considering my application. I look forward to provide more detailed information in an interview with COMPANY.

Sincerely yours,
